  p Resources are at the heart of Nodulator. This object allows you to modelize 
    | and manipulate documents or tables from DB system. 
  p Here is the simpliest way to declare and to use a Resource : 

  codetoggle
    livescript
      include ../../../exemples/ls/resourcebasics.ls
    coffee
      include ../../../exemples/coffee/resourcebasics.coffee
    js
      include ../../../exemples/js/resourcebasics.js
      
  br
  p But you can also just call the Resource and get the created resource throught 'N.' :
    livescript
      | N  \player
      | N.Players.Create name: \test
  br
      
  p The arguments a Resource can take are describe here: 
    bash N  name, [Route], [Config]

  br
  p The Route and Config arguments are both optionals and can be swaped
      
  p This call returns a Players Resource object that represents your models in DB
    
  p You can get and manage your models thanks a Resource, with theses Class methods (for exemple with a 'Players' resource, and a 'player' instance):
    ul
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/create") Players.Create()
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/fetch") Players.Fetch()
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/list") Players.List()
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/deleteres") Players.Delete()
        
    | And theses Instance methods: 

    ul
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/save") player.Save()
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/deleteins") player.Delete()
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/tojson") player.ToJSON()
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/serialize") player.Serialize()
      li
        a(href="#/doc/resource/extendsafe") player.ExtendSafe()
